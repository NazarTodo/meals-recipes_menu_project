                    "description": "Shiraz is the most widely planted red grape variety in Australia. It is known for producing outstanding rich reds with a classic spicy finish. Shiraz has long been recognised for growing particularly well in the warmer and drier regions such as those of South Australia and Mudgee in New South Wales. In these environments, it achieves a richness of varietal character and depth of concentration that best suits our Diamond Label style.The grapes for this wine were sourced predominantly from our vineyards in South Australias McLaren Vale and Langhorne Creek, with a proportion from Mudgee in New South Wales and also Murray River Valley. In McLaren Vale, the long generous summers generally are tempered by cooling breezes from the Gulf of St. Vincent and Lake Alexandrina, whilst the night time cool of the Blue Mountains produces similar conditions in Mudgee. These cool periods enable the colour pigments and natural acidity within the fruit to stabilise, thus allowing the typically full, spicy flavours of the variety to ripen whilst retaining overall structural balance.",

Add the olive oil and let it get really hot.  While it heats, prepare the other ingredients.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Generously salt the chuck roast on both sides.  I like kosher salt because it adheres more readily to the meat.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Cut a couple of onions in half from root to tip...                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Then cut off the tops and bottoms and peel off the papery skin.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            When the pot is very hot, place the onions in the oil and brown on both sides, about a minute per side.  Remove the onions to a plate.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Now, with the burner on high, deglaze the pot by adding 1 cup of the beef stock, whisking constantly.  The point of deglazing is to loosen all of the burned flavorful bits from the bottom of the pot.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Throw the carrots into the same (very hot) pot.  Toss them around until slightly brown, about a minute or so.  The point here is to get a nice color started on the outside of the vegetables, not to cook them.                                                                                                                             9                                                                            Remove the carrots from the pot and allow the pot to get really hot again.  Add another tablespoon of oil to the pan.                                                                                                                            10                                                                            Place the meat in the pot and sear it, about a minute per side.  Remove to a plate.                                                                                                                            11                                                                            Now, with the burner on high, deglaze the pot by adding 1 cup of the beef stock, whisking constantly.  The point of deglazing is to loosen all of the burned flavorful bits from the bottom of the pot.                                                                                                                            12                                                                            When most of the bits are loosened, place the meat back in the pot...                                                                                                                            13                                                                            Followed by the carrots and onions.  Pour enough beef stock into the pot to cover the meat halfway.                                                                                                                            14                                                                            Next, put in the fresh rosemary and thyme sprigs.  The fresh herbs absolutely make this dish.  Tuck them into the juice to ensure that the flavors are distributed throughout the pot.                                                                                                                            15                                                                            Now, just cover the pot and roast for 3 to 5 hours, depending on the size of your roast. For a 3-pound roast, allow 3 to 3 1/2 hours.  For a 5-pound roast, allow for a 4- to 5-hour cooking time.  Don't disrupt the roast during the cooking process.                                                                                                                            16                                                                            When the cooking time is over, check the roast for doneness; a fork should go in easily and the meat should be very tender.  Remove the meat to a cutting board and slice against the grain.",
